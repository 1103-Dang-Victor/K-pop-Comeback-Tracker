## Installation 
If you would like to fork the repository and run the website modifying it in your own remote environment, here is how to do so. For this project, I am using a Windows 10 machine so I utilized the .msi file in the download page but I had to troubleshoot to get it to work. Regarding specifics, I am on npm v10.9.2 and node v22.13.1. 

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ensuring the version is at least v18.18 or later using fnm and npm if on Windows
If you would like to check the versions you have in the CLI: 
```
	npm -v
	node -v
```

- Click the Fork button in the top right of the repo, specifying where to fork it
- After forking, you should be in the forked repo now. Click on the green code button and copy the link
- In your editor of choice go to the command line and now type
``` 
	git clone {the copied link}
```

- In the repo on the CLI if you want to start the dev server, type in the CLI:
```	
	npm run dev
``` 
- And ctrl-c in the CLI to stop the server
